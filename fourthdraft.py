Certainly! Here's an updated version of the code that includes bar chart and line plot visualizations for the performance comparison:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the data containing process names and performance metrics
data = pd.read_csv('performance_data.csv')

# Separate data for Azure workspace and on-premise workspace
azure_data = data[data['Environment'] == 'Azure']
on_premise_data = data[data['Environment'] == 'On-premise']

# Select the relevant performance metrics
metrics = ['Max_IO_Read', 'Max_IO_Write', 'Avg_IO_Read', 'Avg_IO_Write']

# Perform statistical analysis for each metric
for metric in metrics:
    azure_metric = azure_data[metric]
    on_premise_metric = on_premise_data[metric]
    
    # Perform t-test for the metric
    t_statistic, p_value = ttest_ind(azure_metric, on_premise_metric)
    
    # Print the results
    print(f"Metric: {metric}")
    print(f"T-Statistic: {t_statistic:.4f}")
    print(f"P-Value: {p_value:.4f}")
    print("")

    # Compare means of the metric between Azure and on-premise workspaces
    mean_azure = azure_metric.mean()
    mean_on_premise = on_premise_metric.mean()
    print(f"Mean {metric} - Azure: {mean_azure:.4f}")
    print(f"Mean {metric} - On-premise: {mean_on_premise:.4f}")
    print("")
    
    # Plot bar chart for visualizing the metric comparison
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    plt.bar(['Azure', 'On-premise'], [mean_azure, mean_on_premise])
    plt.xlabel('Environment')
    plt.ylabel(metric)
    plt.title(f'{metric} Comparison - Azure vs. On-premise')
    plt.show()
    
    # Plot line plot for visualizing the metric comparison over time (assuming you have a 'Timestamp' column in your data)
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    sns.lineplot(data=data, x='Timestamp', y=metric, hue='Environment')
    plt.xlabel('Timestamp')
    plt.ylabel(metric)
    plt.title(f'{metric} Comparison - Azure vs. On-premise over Time')
    plt.show()

```

In this updated code, after performing the statistical analysis and printing the results, we include bar chart and line plot visualizations using the matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

The code includes a bar chart that compares the mean values of the performance metric between the Azure and on-premise workspaces. Each environment is represented on the x-axis, and the mean metric values are plotted on the y-axis.

Additionally, the code includes a line plot that visualizes the performance metric comparison over time. This assumes that you have a 'Timestamp' column in your data, indicating the time at which the measurements were taken. The line plot shows the metric values for both environments over time, with different colors representing each environment.

Again, please make sure to adjust the code according to your specific data structure, column names, and visualization requirements.

Note: The line plot assumes a continuous timeline and may not be suitable for irregularly spaced or non-temporal data. If your data does not have a time component, you can modify the code to visualize the metric comparison using other types of plots, such as grouped bar charts or violin plots.
