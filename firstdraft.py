Certainly! Here's an example Python code that demonstrates the performance comparison and statistical analysis using the data containing process names, maximum I/O read and write values, and average I/O read and write values:

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Load the data containing process names and performance metrics
data = pd.read_csv('performance_data.csv')

# Separate data for Azure workspace and on-premise workspace
azure_data = data[data['Environment'] == 'Azure']
on_premise_data = data[data['Environment'] == 'On-premise']

# Select the relevant performance metrics
metrics = ['Max_IO_Read', 'Max_IO_Write', 'Avg_IO_Read', 'Avg_IO_Write']

# Perform statistical analysis for each metric
for metric in metrics:
    azure_metric = azure_data[metric]
    on_premise_metric = on_premise_data[metric]
    
    # Perform t-test for the metric
    t_statistic, p_value = ttest_ind(azure_metric, on_premise_metric)
    
    # Print the results
    print(f"Metric: {metric}")
    print(f"T-Statistic: {t_statistic:.4f}")
    print(f"P-Value: {p_value:.4f}")
    print("")

    # Compare means of the metric between Azure and on-premise workspaces
    mean_azure = azure_metric.mean()
    mean_on_premise = on_premise_metric.mean()
    print(f"Mean {metric} - Azure: {mean_azure:.4f}")
    print(f"Mean {metric} - On-premise: {mean_on_premise:.4f}")
    print("")

```

In this example, we assume that the performance data is stored in a CSV file named 'performance_data.csv', which contains columns for 'Environment', 'Process_Name', 'Max_IO_Read', 'Max_IO_Write', 'Avg_IO_Read', and 'Avg_IO_Write'. The 'Environment' column denotes whether the data belongs to the Azure workspace or on-premise workspace.

The code separates the data based on the environment and selects the relevant performance metrics to analyze. It then performs a t-test using the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module to compare the metrics between the Azure and on-premise workspaces. The t-statistic and p-value are calculated and printed for each metric.

Additionally, the code calculates and prints the mean values of each metric for both environments to compare the average performance.

Please note that you may need to modify the code based on the structure and format of your specific data file.
