Certainly! Here's an updated version of the code that includes visualization for the performance comparison:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the data containing process names and performance metrics
data = pd.read_csv('performance_data.csv')

# Separate data for Azure workspace and on-premise workspace
azure_data = data[data['Environment'] == 'Azure']
on_premise_data = data[data['Environment'] == 'On-premise']

# Select the relevant performance metrics
metrics = ['Max_IO_Read', 'Max_IO_Write', 'Avg_IO_Read', 'Avg_IO_Write']

# Perform statistical analysis for each metric
for metric in metrics:
    azure_metric = azure_data[metric]
    on_premise_metric = on_premise_data[metric]
    
    # Perform t-test for the metric
    t_statistic, p_value = ttest_ind(azure_metric, on_premise_metric)
    
    # Print the results
    print(f"Metric: {metric}")
    print(f"T-Statistic: {t_statistic:.4f}")
    print(f"P-Value: {p_value:.4f}")
    print("")

    # Compare means of the metric between Azure and on-premise workspaces
    mean_azure = azure_metric.mean()
    mean_on_premise = on_premise_metric.mean()
    print(f"Mean {metric} - Azure: {mean_azure:.4f}")
    print(f"Mean {metric} - On-premise: {mean_on_premise:.4f}")
    print("")
    
    # Plot boxplot for visualizing the metric comparison
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.boxplot(x=data['Environment'], y=data[metric])
    plt.xlabel('Environment')
    plt.ylabel(metric)
    plt.title(f'{metric} Comparison - Azure vs. On-premise')
    plt.show()

```

In this updated code, after performing the statistical analysis and printing the results, we include a boxplot visualization using the seaborn library to compare the performance metric between the Azure and on-premise workspaces. The boxplot provides a visual representation of the distribution and summary statistics, such as median, quartiles, and potential outliers, for each environment.

To run this code, you need to have the seaborn and matplotlib libraries installed. You may also need to adjust the code based on your data structure and specific visualization requirements.

Note that this code generates separate boxplots for each performance metric. If you want to compare multiple metrics in a single plot, you can modify the code accordingly, such as by creating subplots or using other types of visualizations like bar charts or line plots.
