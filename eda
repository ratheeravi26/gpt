In the session, you can highlight the following EDA techniques for identifying processes that are slowing down the Azure workspace compared to on-premise:

1. Summary Statistics:
   - Compute and present descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for relevant variables.
   - Identify key statistics that can provide insights into the performance differences between Azure workspace and on-premise.

2. Data Visualization:
   - Utilize various plots and charts to visually explore the data.
   - Histograms can help identify the distribution of variables and identify potential outliers.
   - Box plots can reveal differences in data distribution between Azure and on-premise processes.
   - Scatter plots can show relationships between variables, such as process duration and I/O operations.

3. Correlation Analysis:
   - Calculate correlation coefficients between different variables to identify potential relationships and dependencies.
   - Focus on exploring correlations between performance-related variables and process characteristics.
   - Use correlation matrices or heatmaps to visualize the correlations.

4. Time Series Analysis:
   - If the data includes timestamps, analyze the data as a time series to identify temporal patterns and trends.
   - Plotting time series data can reveal seasonality, cyclical patterns, or sudden changes in performance.
   - Calculate rolling averages or moving averages to smooth out noise and identify long-term trends.

5. Outlier Detection:
   - Identify and investigate any outliers or extreme values in the data.
   - Outliers might indicate anomalous processes that are significantly impacting performance.
   - Employ statistical techniques like z-scores, box plots, or clustering algorithms to detect outliers.

6. Dimensionality Reduction:
   - Consider using dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the complexity of the data and identify key factors contributing to performance differences.
   - Visualize the reduced-dimensional data to gain insights into the separability of Azure and on-premise processes.

It's important to note that the selection of specific EDA techniques should depend on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis. The techniques mentioned above provide a starting point, but you can tailor the selection to best suit the dataset and the insights you want to uncover.
